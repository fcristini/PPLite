description       A modern C++ library providing numerical abstractions
long_description  The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a modern C++ library \
		  providing numerical abstractions especially targeted at \
		  applications in the field of analysis and verification of \
		  complex systems. The PPL can handle all the convex \
		  polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a \
		  finite number of (open or closed) hyperspaces, each \
		  described by an equality or inequality (strict or \
		  non-strict) with rational coefficients. The PPL also \
		  handles restricted classes of polyhedra that offer \
		  interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs. The library \
		  also supports finite powersets of (any kind of) polyhedra \
		  and linear programming problems solved with an \
		  exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm.
